/**
 * Read-receipt (READ_IN) machinery, extracted from the useChat god-hook. Owns the single source of
 * the read boundary (the newest rendered SERVER ULID) and the three triggers that (re)send READ_IN
 * for the open+visible chat: tab becomes visible, the socket (re)connects, and a new message
 * arrives. `sendReadReceipt` is also handed back so `openChat` can mark-read on open.
 *
 * Behavior is preserved verbatim from useChat, including the ONE deliberate asymmetry:
 *  - visible/open (onVisible) and openChat send a READ_IN even when the boundary is still unknown
 *    (empty correlationId) — the peer receives a READ_OUT and the boundary catches up on the next
 *    trigger;
 *  - the connect and newest-message triggers require a known boundary (`requireBoundary`) so they
 *    don't emit a boundary-less frame on every reconnect / cache tick.
